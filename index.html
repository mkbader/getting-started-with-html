<h2>Basics of the Web</h2>
<br>
<h3><font color="f8f8ff"> 5 Elements of the Web<br><br>
  Web, HTML, URLs, HTTP, Web Applications<br>
  <br>
  What is the WWW?<br>
  Collection of HTML Documents with hyperlinks.  Over 30 billion of them!<br>
  <br>
  Major Pieces<br>
  You at your computer with a web browser<br>
  Internet<br>
  HTTP for communicating from your browser to a backend server<br>
  Backend servers optimized for responding to HTTP(s) request<br>
  <br>
  What is HTML?<br>
  Text or content, markup (what it looks like), references to other<br>
  documents, and links to other pages<br>
  <br>
  Deeper dive into Markup<br>
  Tags- change the way content is displayed<br>
  Attributes- propoerties of some tags that<br>
  specify more specific display behaviors<br>
  <br>
  Includes b, em (emphasis), a, image, for example, <br>
  placing the word word in bold tags looks like this <b>word</b>
  <br>
There are void tags that do not need to be closed, e.g, img
<br>
Together the tags and the content are called an element
<br>
Tags can be inline or block, the difference is block creates an invisible<br>
box around the element that can have it's own attributes such as height and width
<br>
HTML Documents are composed of various sections<br>
Doctype, head (typically titles, metadata, and any css file or javascript<br>
would be exposed here, and the body.  In this course, we will mainly focus on body.
